# Wedding Gifts

In some weddings, people don't offer gifts, but rather send money
to the new married couple or give them in an envelope during the wedding day.

Help the couples to count the money from the envelopes after the wedding,
and also count the number of empty envelopes.

Write a function:

     let solution = (envelopes) => ...;

that, given a list of envelopes that might or might not have money in them,
returns the total value of money and the total number of empty envelopes as
a tuple: `(amount, emptyEnvelopes)`.
