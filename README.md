Hello! :wave:

These are some exercises to start learning Reason. Solutions not included. :innocent:

All contributions are welcomed!

## Sources

This project is influenced by the [Exercism ReasonML repo](https://github.com/exercism/reasonml).

## Requirements

- yarn or npm
- If you're on vscode, [the `reason-vscode` plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jaredly.reason-vscode)

## Install

```bash
yarn run install
```

## Build + Watch

```
yarn run build
```

Note: With reason-vscode plugin, there is no need to watch manually as the plugin does it for you.

In watch mode, you can use `p` to filter by regexp / file name.
